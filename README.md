## Where is this repository for?
This repository is for my lessons from the minor Web Development from the HvA. 

## What's the goal of this repository?
In this repository I've made a overview of cooking books from the OBA. My goal of this repo is to learn JavaScript more and understand it a bit better.

## Usage
With this application you can look through some of the cooking books OBA has to offer. You can get more information about the pieces and make your own perspectives on it. You can also search within these items.

## Example images

## Installation
Clone this repository to your own device:
```console
git clone https://github.com/ROEL2407/OBA.git
```

Use a local server to host the website. I use the Live server extension in Visual Studio Code to host.

## Online version
If you don't want to download everything, there's an online version for you [here](https://roel2407.github.io/OBA/).

## Commits
In this repo I will commit my work. To make this more visible for myself and others I've added little headers to the commit titles:
* Created = a file is created
* Updated = updated a file or piece of code
* Delete = deleted a file

## Resources
### Credits
* Our teachers at the minor Web Development.
* My fellow students who've helped me resolving some problems and learning me new types of tricks.
* Stackoverflow for giving me the answer that I could tweak or that helped me understand my problem in the code better.
